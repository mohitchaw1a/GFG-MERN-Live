1. git clone <repository_name> cloning the repository
2. git checkout -b <branch_name> creating a new branch
3. git status - what all changes have been done locally to the project folder.
4. git add <file_name> - It will add only file, the file_name which you are giving
5. git add . - It will add all file that are added for stage.
6. git commit -m "commit-msg" - This will commit staged changes from your local branch.
7. git commit -am "commit-msg" -Add + commit.
8. git checkout <branch_name> - will take you to the branch
9. git push origin <branch_name> - It pushes the changes
10. git pull origin <branch_name> - It pulls changes from the branch
11. git fetch origin  - fetches everything tags/branches and refereneces from remote
12. git log - It will show you all the commit history that we have done.
13. git cmd_type --help.
14. git stash - stores the changes done locally
15. git stash apply - applies the changes back done locally.
14. git merge 
15. git rebase.
